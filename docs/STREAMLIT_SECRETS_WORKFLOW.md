# 🔐 Streamlit Cloud Secrets Workflow

This guide explains exactly how to handle secrets for Streamlit Cloud deployment.

## 🤔 **The Confusion**

You asked: *"How can I set secrets if both .env and .streamlit/secrets.toml are ignored?"*

This is a great question! Let me clarify how this actually works.

## 🔄 **How Streamlit Cloud Secrets Work**

### **The Key Insight:**
- **Git ignores the secrets files** (for security)
- **But Streamlit Cloud can still read them** during deployment

### **The Workflow:**

```
1. You create .streamlit/secrets.toml locally ✅
2. You push code to GitHub (secrets file is ignored) ✅
3. Streamlit Cloud reads the secrets file from your local deployment ✅
4. Your app runs with secrets in production ✅
```

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Deployment Process**

### **Step 1: Verify Your Local Setup**

```bash
# Check that your secrets file exists locally
ls -la .streamlit/secrets.toml

# Verify it contains your API keys
cat .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

### **Step 2: Push to GitHub (Secrets Stay Local)**

```bash
# Add your code (secrets file will be ignored)
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment"

# Push to GitHub (secrets file is NOT uploaded)
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**

1. **Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)**
2. **Connect your GitHub repository**
3. **Streamlit Cloud will automatically read your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file**
4. **Deploy!**

## 🔍 **Alternative: Streamlit Cloud Dashboard Secrets**

If the file-based approach doesn't work, you can also set secrets directly in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard:

### **Option 2: Dashboard Secrets**

1. **Deploy your app to Streamlit Cloud**
2. **Go to your app's settings in Streamlit Cloud**
3. **Add secrets in the dashboard:**

```toml
[ai_config]
openai_api_key = "your-openai-api-key"
gemini_api_key = "your-gemini-api-key"
default_model = "gemini"
```

## 🧪 **Testing Your Setup**

### **Test 1: Local Development**
```bash
# This should work (uses .env file)
streamlit run streamlit/streamlit_app_simple.py
```

### **Test 2: Verify Git Ignores Secrets**
```bash
# This should NOT show secrets files
git status
```

### **Test 3: Check Secret Loading**
```bash
# Test that config loads correctly
python -c "from config import config; print('OpenAI:', config.is_model_available('gpt')); print('Gemini:', config.is_model_available('gemini'))"
```

## 🔒 **Security Benefits**

### **Why This Approach is Secure:**

1. **✅ Secrets never go to Git** - They stay on your local machine
2. **✅ Streamlit Cloud can read them** - During deployment process
3. **✅ Local development works** - Uses .env file
4. **✅ Production deployment works** - Uses Streamlit secrets
5. **✅ No hardcoded secrets** - Everything is externalized

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Streamlit Cloud Can't Read Secrets:**

1. **Check file location:** `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (not `.streamlit/secrets.toml`)
2. **Check file format:** Must be valid TOML
3. **Use dashboard secrets:** As a fallback option

### **If Local Development Fails:**

1. **Check `.env` file exists**
2. **Verify API keys are correct**
3. **Run the test script**

## 📋 **Complete Deployment Checklist**

- [ ] `.streamlit/secrets.toml` exists locally with correct API keys
- [ ] `.env` file exists for local development
- [ ] `.gitignore` excludes both secret files
- [ ] `config.py` supports multiple secret sources
- [ ] Local app runs successfully
- [ ] Code is pushed to GitHub (without secrets)
- [ ] Streamlit Cloud deployment is configured
- [ ] App works in production

## 🎯 **Summary**

**The secret is:** Streamlit Cloud reads the `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file **during deployment**, not from Git. The file exists locally, gets ignored by Git (for security), but Streamlit Cloud can still access it when you deploy.

This gives you the best of both worlds:
- **Security** (secrets not in Git)
- **Functionality** (secrets available in production)
- **Simplicity** (no complex setup required)

**🚀 You're ready to deploy!** Follow the steps above and your app will work perfectly on Streamlit Cloud with secure secrets.
